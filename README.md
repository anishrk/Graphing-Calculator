# Graphing-Calculator
Graphs many different polynomial functions(Ex: x^2-x+5)
Graphs all six trigonometric functions(sin x,cos x,tan x,csc x,sec x,cot x)
Graphs exponential and logarithmic functions(e^x,ln x,log_10(x))
First enter the functions as shown above
Then click first derivative or second derivative to display the graph of the function's first derivative or second derivative
Type in an interval and then press the max/min button or point of inflection button to find those points in between the interval 
Type in the values that the program will then calculate the integral for
